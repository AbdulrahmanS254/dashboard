# 📊 React Admin Dashboard (Learning Journey)

> **Current Status:** 🚧 Under Development (Phase 1: UI & Structure)

A modern, responsive Admin Dashboard built with **React** and **Material UI (MUI)**. 
This project serves as a practical playground to master component-based styling libraries and advanced state management.

## 🎯 Learning Goals & Motivation

This project is not just about building a dashboard; it's about mastering specific architectural and styling concepts:

* **Mastering Material UI:** Moving beyond utility-first CSS (Tailwind) to understand **Component-Based Styling** and the MUI `sx` prop system.
* **Professional UI/UX:** Creating a "pixel-perfect," industry-standard interface suitable for real-world admin panels.
* **Scalable Structure:** Designing a layout that handles complex navigation (Sidebar, Navbar, Nested Routes).
* **State Management (Upcoming):** Implementing **Redux Toolkit** to manage global application state effectively.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Framework:** [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) (Vite)
* **Styling:** [Material UI (MUI)](https://mui.com/) - Core & Icons
* **Routing:** React Router DOM v6
* **State Management:** Redux Toolkit *(Planned for Phase 2)*
* **Charts:** *(Planned: Recharts or Chart.js)*

## 🗺️ Project Roadmap

I am building this project in two distinct phases to ensure focus and code quality:

### Phase 1: The UI Shell (Current Focus 🎨)
* [x] Project Setup with Vite & MUI.
* [ ] **Layout Architecture:** Building a responsive Sidebar (Drawer) and Top Navbar.
* [ ] **Component Styling:** Customizing MUI components (Buttons, Inputs, Cards) to fit a specific theme.
* [ ] **Static Pages:** Designing the "Dashboard Home", "Users List", and "Products" views with placeholder data.
* [ ] **Responsive Design:** Ensuring the drawer and grid system work seamlessly on mobile.

### Phase 2: Logic & Interactivity (Upcoming ⚙️)
* [ ] **Redux Integration:** Setting up the Store, Slices, and Providers.
* [ ] **Data Fetching:** Replacing static data with simulated API calls.
* [ ] **CRUD Operations:** Making the "Add/Edit Product" forms functional.
* [ ] **Dynamic Charts:** Visualizing real data.
